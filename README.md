-Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

    DriverPass is a system that is used by student drivers. It contains classes and other material to assist the student pass their driving test. This applies to the driving portaion and the written test. Students will be able to take lesson, take exams, schdule practice drives, and take practice exam. The students will be require to create an account with this service.  

-What did you do particularly well?

    Maybe interprete what the client wanted. I also felt like because I was able to interpret the clients need allowed me to create better diagrams for this project. 

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    Honestly, I would of liked to spent more time working on my graphs and visuals for this project. I felt rushed and I wanted to spend more time to perfect the diagrams. 

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    I know the client was not tech savvy and I felt I did well interpreting their needs and using tech language in a way they would understand the product better. After starting to create graphs and diagrams for their project help me visual their needs and allowed me to create a better product. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    I think the diagrams were important when developing this project. It allowed to visual most aspect of the project, including a time frame for the groups involved in the development of this. It also painted a clear picture to the client on how we interprete their needs. If corrections were needed, it could be discussed in front of the diagram.
